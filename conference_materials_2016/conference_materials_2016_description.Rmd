## Project Description 

This project was implemented to further develop methods that were originated previously (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1406860) as part of a larger project (F32DK107157) to study common biases and statistical mistakes made in nutrition and obesity research. One such bias is p-hacking. As the poster describes in more detail, this project replicated a previously implemented rapid and high-volume method for detecting p-hacking in scientific literature, as well as refined previous methods. Details of these changes are described in more detail below. This work has since been further developed and presented on, and a manuscript with fully-developed methods is now being developed for publication. 


An abbreviated description of these two projects is as follows:

* 2014: Initial, manual search in PubMed
* 2016: Replication of 2014, refinement of search methods, and inclusion of search within PubMed dietary supplement subset


## Conference Description

Asterisks in PubMed are used to indicate wildcards. PubMed returns wildcards and shows the terms returned for manual inspection. Expansion of the 0.05\* term above shows these wildcards expanded. Search 0.05* is expanded to remove inclusion of the commonly found mention of p < 0.05 in abstracts. PubMed interprets any equality characters (<, =, >) as blank spaces. An asterisk alone could not be used here, as we needed to manually remove references to 0.05. These are not likely to represent values in a bin, because they could represent the entire inequality of p < 0.05 or reference to a significance level threshold.


__Search string details for method b__

```{r}
# p-value bin 0.03: same as method a
# p-value bin 0.04: same as method a
# p-value bin 0.05: same as method a
# p-value bin 0.06: same as method a
# common tests: (t-test[tiab] OR "t test" OR t-student[tiab] OR anova[tiab] OR ANOVA[tiab] OR ancova[tiab] OR "mixed model"[tiab] OR "parametric tests")
# atypical tests: (nonparametric[tiab] OR non-parametric[tiab] OR "non parametric" OR wilcoxon-mann-whitney[tiab] OR mann-whitney[tiab] OR u-test[tiab] OR wilcoxon[tiab] OR wlicoxon-rank[tiab] OR "wilcoxon rank"[tiab] OR kruskal-wallis[tiab] OR "kruskal wallis"[tiab] OR log-transformed[tiab] OR "log transformed"[tiab] OR (outlier*[tiab] AND remov*[tiab]))
```


Reasons for changes: 

* Common tests: "t test", t-student, ANOVA, and "parametric tests" were added as they are revelant common tests, and different versions (i.e. addition or removal of a "-") yielded additional results. 
* Atypical tests: "transformation" was removed, as it was found to yield numerous irrelevant results. "non parametric", wilcoxon-mann-whitney, mann-whitney, u-test, wilcoxon, log-transformed, and "log transformed" were added, as these terms were found to yield additional relevant results. 


### PubMed query data file

A .csv file with the search query conducted in PubMed on 5/9/16, plus extractions times also has been added. This was exported by PubMed after the search. The date column was added manually, as PubMed does not include this in the export of searches. The PubMed export for pm_b_org_man and dss_b_org_man could not be located. The search query was documented manually, and these details were added to the data file. This is a testament to the importance of preparing study materials for open sharing during the research process, as apposed to two years later.

## A Note on How to Replicate this Study 

Because data were extracted from PubMed manually on a specific date, one would need to download PubMed history and assess the literature from the point in time noted in the data file, using the methods described in this document. Another option might be to run the search described herein and subtract dates from the date reported in our data file. We have not done this ourselves. However, this work does replicate previous findings in the same literature set at a later date.
